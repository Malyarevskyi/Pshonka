    <h1>Chef "Pshonka"</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center;">Pshonka had already become a superb restaurant. I took notice how well the menu was
        designed. I had to suggest something in line with the existing level and quality. And the most challenging work
        was to be done on those dishes that were a good match for the restaurant.»</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Igor Bednaykov:“A chef should travel widely”</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Igor Bednaykov is the chef of Pshonka Restaurant, Andrey Dellos’ pioneer project.
        Pshonka was opened in 1996, offering its guests home cuisine and relaxing atmosphere of a medieval inn. In 2010
        Pshonka was closed for renovation and reopened as a gastronomic restaurant with differently organized and
        decorated space and revamped menu concept.
        Igor Bednaykov is talking about Pshonka’s past and present, home and molecular cuisine, ordinary cooks and chefs
        as well as about the nature of taste.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">About the career choice</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I always knew that I would become a chef. I enrolled at
    Vocational School Number 41 and graduated with distinction. On graduation, most students qualify as ‘Grade 4
    Multi-Skilled Cooks’.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> In those times, grades were of particular importance.
    First of all, it was an indicator of professional growth, then, your wages depended on it.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">> Internationally, references provided by the previous
    employer are widely used when applying for a new job. And I believe that this is the right approach. You may always
    contact the chef or the restaurant and clarify details.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> After graduating, I joined Fantasia Restaurant in Gorky
    Park. There I made first steps in my profession. Then I was invited to work for The Palace Hotel at Belorusskaya
    station. The Palace Hotel had a very well equipped kitchen, with desktop blenders, combi steamers and vacuum
    machines. It was a rare thing for the 1990s. There I received extensive experience of working with the European
    cuisine and got familiar with advanced cooking technologies.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> About Pshonka</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I was offered the role of sous-chef at the newly opened
    Pushkin Café where Andrey Makhov was the chef. I worked there four years before being recommended to fill the chef’s
    role at Pshonka where I opened the door for new horizons for creativity and bringing all my ideas to life.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Pshonka had already become a superb restaurant. I had to
    suggest something new in terms of both the dish serving and cooking technology. And I put all of my passion into it!
    I introduced a new technology of preparing banquet dishes right in the banqueting hall, in front of the guests. One
    of them was a spit-roasted young bull that has become the restaurant’s iconic dish. In the late 90s, Pshonka was in
    fact the only restaurant which had a huge barbeque in the middle of the hall where a whole lamb or young bull could
    be prepared.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> I would not rather say about hits at Pshonka. There are
    traditional dishes at Pshonka which our guests have been going to sample for many, many years. And what are hits? A
    young bull roasted on a rotisserie is definitely a hit. This is our specialty. Tsar cutlet is another good example.
    One raw cutlet weighs 450 grams, we have created cutlets of four types – lamb, chicken, fish and beef. They all took
    off.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> But hits may also change over the time, of course.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Today, this dish is a hit, tomorrow you will come up
    with something better, and this something becomes a hit. The more dishes on the menu, the fewer hits you have.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> After renovation, Pshonka became a more modern
    restaurant with a gastronomic twist. However, we do not forget about home cuisine. Pike in marinade as well as the
    Olivier salad are still on the menu. We revamped the serving of some of the old dishes. We changed the style, the
    tableware. But their taste remained the same. It was a pleasure to see our regular guests coming after renovation
    and saying: “We have been really missing your cabbage rolls and pies!” Therefore I believe that it is very
    interesting for the restaurant to have modern gastronomic cuisine and Russian home cuisine going hand in hand..</p>
